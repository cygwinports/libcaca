ldesc: "libcaca is a graphics library that outputs text instead of pixels, so
that it can work on older video cards or text terminals. It is not
unlike the famous AAlib library, except that colors are supported.
libcaca can use almost any virtual terminal to work, thus it should work
on all Unix systems (including Mac OS X) using either the slang library
or the ncurses library, on DOS using the conio library, and on Windows
systems using either slang or ncurses (through Cygwin emulation) or
conio. There is also a native X11 driver that does not require a text
terminal."
